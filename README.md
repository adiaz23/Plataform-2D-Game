# Enchanted Forest
I developed a platform game in which the player takes the role of a female warrior, who is searching for the lost treasure of her village, to prove that she is worthy of her God's blessing. The game is for all audiences and is developed to run in browsers.

## Mechanics

The game mechanics are:

- Side-scrolling movement and jump.
- Melee attack with animation.
- Three enemy types with unique behaviors.
- Fireballs triggered on player detection.
- Health system and item drops.
- Collectibles: coin, potion, gem, and star (for double jump).
- Double jump unlocked via collectible.
- Moving platforms that carry the player.
- Checkpoints and respawn system.
- Global 2D lighting.
- SFX for hits and explosions.
- Background music.
- Pause, Game Over, and Win screens.
- Tutorial level with controls.
